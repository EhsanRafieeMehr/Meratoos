# Meratoos

Meratoos is a lightweight, modular frontend project built with plain HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Swiper.js. The goal of this repository is to provide a clean, understandable foundation for building and experimenting with small interactive web interfaces without relying on heavy frameworks.

This project emphasizes clarity, simplicity, and good engineering practices, making it suitable for learning, prototyping, or serving as a starter template for future web projects.

## Design Philosophy

Meratoos follows a few simple principles:

- **Simplicity first**: Minimal dependencies, with Swiper used only where interaction is required
- **Clarity over cleverness**: Code should be readable before it is clever
- **Scalability**: Structure allows easy growth into a larger project
